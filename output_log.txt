guidelines:
  - **Relevance:** Only use keywords that truly fit with the experience you're
    describing.
  - **Natural Language:** Keywords should fit smoothly into the sentences. Don't
    just list keywords or force them in where they don't belong.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** Use strong action verbs and remove unnecessary
    words. Focus on making a big impact with few words. Summarize each
    experience in 1-2 short, powerful sentences, just like you would on a resume.

    keywords that accurately show the skills you used and what you were
    responsible for.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Using too many keywords can actually hurt your
    chances. Aim for a balanced and impactful description without repeating
    keywords too much.

agent=ATS Keyword Integrator2024-05-14 09:34:59: task=This task helps you create compelling resume bullet points by adding important keywords from a job description to descriptions of your work experiences. The goal is to make these descriptions stand out to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), while also being easy to read and understand.
guidelines:
  - **Relevance:** Only use keywords that truly fit with the experience you're
    describing.
  - **Natural Language:** Keywords should fit smoothly into the sentences. Don't
    just list keywords or force them in where they don't belong.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** Use strong action verbs and remove unnecessary
    words. Focus on making a big impact with few words. Summarize each
    experience in 1-2 short, powerful sentences, just like you would on a resume.
  - **Context Matters:** Think about the overall story of each experience. Pick
    keywords that accurately show the skills you used and what you were
    responsible for.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Using too many keywords can actually hurt your
    chances. Aim for a balanced and impactful description without repeating
    keywords too much.
