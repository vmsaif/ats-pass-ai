    This task involves extracting comprehensive information about an applicant across multiple dimensions including personal information, education, volunteer work, awards, references, and personal traits, any philosophy, and goals. The information will be extracted from a structured data source provided in the context.
    
    For each category, specific questions will be formulated and asked through the tool. Each category requires careful examination of the returned data to ensure all required fields are accurately populated.

    Here is the structured data you need to extract the applicant's information from:

ats_friendly_skills_task:
  description: >
    Compare the skills listed in a job description with the applicant's skills. This task involves identifying exact matches, researching partial matches, and noting any missing skills. The comparison will utilize two sources: job description keywords and the applicant’s combined skills list, provided in a JSON format.

    **Procedure**:
    1. **Identification of Matches**:
       - **Exact Match**: Directly compare skills from the job description with the applicant's skills for each category.
       - **Partial Match**: Identify skills in the applicant’s profile that are similar but not identical to those in the job description. Focus on populating as many partial matches as possible by using an online search tool to research each skill’s scope and relevance. This includes exploring related technologies, frameworks, or methodologies that might not be a direct match but are conceptually or functionally similar.
       - **Missing Skills**: List skills present in the job description but absent in the applicant’s profile.

    2. **Report Generation**:
       - Prepare a JSON report detailing the types:
          -- **Exact Matches**: Directly matching skills by category.
          -- **Partial Matches**: Populate this section robustly by listing each related skill from the applicant's list that has any connection to the job description skills, including a brief on their relevance or how they complement the job skills.
          -- **Missing Skills**: List skills from the job description that are completely absent in the applicant's skill set.
       - Emphasize more on the partial matches, exploring every possible connection between the applicant's skills and the job requirements to maximize relevance and coverage.

correct_categorization_of_skills_task:
  description: >
    Ensure all skills listed are correctly categorized according to their relevance to specific job fields.

    **Instructions**:
    - Review each skill provided in the list and then determine its appropriate category based on its primary application and industry relevance.
    
    - Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.
    To use the web search tool: 
      query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")
    
    Search multiple times if needed to find the correct category of the skill with different queries. Do not search if you are already familiar with the skill.

    - Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management.
    
    - If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new category that accurately represents its field of application.

    **Output**:
    - Provide a list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 5 categories in the final output. 
    
    Remember, "exact_match_with_job_description" and "partial_match" are most prioritized. If their count is not enough to fill the categories, you can add some skills from the "Applicant's Skills" list. Maintain priority for the exact and partial matches and its categories first.

    Here is the list of all the skills the applicant has:
    {applicant_skills}

    This is the Job Description. You might use this to get the idea of possible categories.

ats_friendly_keywords_into_experiences:
  description: >
    Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.

    **Guidelines:**
      - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
      - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
      - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
        -- Limit the short description to 10-15 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
        -- Keep or make 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
        -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 15 tokens.
        - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
      - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
      - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

    **Job Description Keywords:**
    {jd_keywords}

    **Missing from the Applicant's Skills:**
    Provided in the context.

    When you are done with listing the experiences with integrated keywords, provide a detailed report on changes in a new section ## Report on Changes:

    ## Report on Changes in structure in JSON:
      - **Original Sentence**: Present the sentence before any updates.
      - **Revised Sentence**: Display the sentence after keywords have been integrated.
      - **Keywords Added**: List each keyword that was newly added, ensuring they were not present before.
      - **Rationale**: Provide a detailed explanation for each keyword addition, URLing the choice to specific requirements or phrases in the job description.

    To determine the duration of the most recent experience, the present date is {today_date}.

  expected_output: >
    Produce a detailed listing for each experience, categorized under 'Most Recent Experience', 'Work Experience' and 'Project Experience', with ATS-optimized descriptions.

        "",
        "",
        ""

    Your ONLY task is to organize the following input data into a JSON object representing a professional resume, EXACTLY as instructed below. Do NOT deviate from these guidelines:

    1.  **Contact Info:** Extract the following fields: "Full Name", "Phone", "Email", "Linkedin Profile URL", "Personal Website URL", and "Address".
    2.  **Summary:** Write down the summary provided in the input data.
    3.  **Skills:** Follow the structure below to organize the skills into categories. 
      - First, fill this section from the "exact_match_with_job_description", then "partial_match_with_job_description", then after that, fill from "skills" and "technologies" from the experiences. Each category should have up to 5 skills.
      {{

      }}
        - Ensure no skill is repeated. Combine variations of the same skill (e.g., "Problem-Solving" and "Problem-solving skills").
        - Carefully determine if a skill is technical (related to tools, technologies) or soft (related to personality, work style). 
    
    4. If "Company Name" or "URL" is not available, omit them.  
    5.  **Additional:** Include any other relevant sections, like "References," based on the input data.

       - You MUST include ALL data from the input. Do NOT leave out any information. If a field is missing, represent it as an empty string ("").
       - Do NOT fabricate, invent, or add ANY information that is not explicitly stated in the input data.
       - Do not infer, assume, or create any details not directly present in the input. 
       - Focus solely on accurately organizing the given information into a structured JSON format.
