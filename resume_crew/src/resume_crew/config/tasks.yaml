personal_information_extraction_task:
  description: >
    You are given a tool that retrieves info simply by asking questions as a list of strings. Use the tool to extract comprehensive personal details.

    How you should use the tool:
    argument:
    "question": "Give me Personal Details about the applicant"

    The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field.
    for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub URL.

    This is what the GitHub profile URL looks like: https://github.com/username
    This is what the GitHub repository URL looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name

    If you find the GitHub repository URL, simply remove the repository name from the URL to make it a GitHub profile URL as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub URL.

education_extraction_task:
  description: >
    Utilize a semantic search tool to extract detailed education information about the Applicant. Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.

    **How to Use the Tool:**
    - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.

    **Initial Query:**
    - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"

    **Refined Query (if needed):**
    - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
      - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
      - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

    For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

ats_friendly_keywords_into_experiences:
  description: >
    Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.

    **Guidelines:**
      - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
      - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
      - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
        -- Limit the short description to 10-15 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
        -- Keep or make 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
        -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-20 words per key highlight. 
        - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
      - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
      - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

    **Job Description Keywords:**
    {jd_keywords}

    **Missing from the Applicant's Skills:**
    Provided in the context.

    Count the total number of experiences. After enhancing the descriptions, provide a detailed report that specifies the changes made, especially any keywords that were integrated.

    When you are done with listing the experiences with integrated keywords, provide a detailed report on changes in a new section ## Report on Changes:

    ## Report on Changes in structure in JSON:
      - **Original Sentence**: Present the sentence before any updates.
      - **Revised Sentence**: Display the sentence after keywords have been integrated.
      - **Keywords Added**: List each keyword that was newly added, ensuring they were not present before.
      - **Rationale**: Provide a detailed explanation for each keyword addition, URLing the choice to specific requirements or phrases in the job description.

    To determine the duration of the most recent experience, the present date is {today_date}.

    Your ONLY task is to organize the following input data into a JSON object representing a professional resume, EXACTLY as instructed below. Do NOT deviate from these guidelines:

    1.  **Contact Info:** Extract the following fields: "Full Name", "Phone", "Email", "URLedIn Profile URL", "Personal Website URL", and "Address".
    2.  **Summary:** Write down the summary provided in the input data.
    3.  **Skills:** Follow the structure below to organize the skills into categories. 
      - First, fill this section from the "exact_match_with_job_description", then "partial_match_with_job_description", then after that, fill from "skills" and "technologies" from the experiences. Each category should have up to 5 skills.
      {{

      }}
        - Ensure no skill is repeated. Combine variations of the same skill (e.g., "Problem-Solving" and "Problem-solving skills").
        - Carefully determine if a skill is technical (related to tools, technologies) or soft (related to personality, work style). 
    
    4. If "Company Name" or "URL" is not available, omit them.  
    5.  **Additional:** Include any other relevant sections, like "References," based on the input data.
