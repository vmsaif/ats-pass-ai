personal_information_extraction_task:
  description: >
    You are given a tool that retrieves info simply by asking questions as a list of strings. Use the tool to extract comprehensive personal details.

    How you should use the tool:
    argument:
    "question": "Give me Personal Details about the applicant"

    The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field.
    for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.

    This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username
    This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name

    If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

education_extraction_task:
  description: >
    Utilize a semantic search tool to extract detailed education information about the Applicant. Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.

    **How to Use the Tool:**
    - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.

    **Initial Query:**
    - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"

    **Refined Query (if needed):**
    - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
      - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
      - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

    For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

ats_friendly_skills_task:
  description: >
    Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.

    **Task Instructions**:

    1. **Sources for Comparison**:
       - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
       - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

    2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
      - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
      query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
      
    3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
        - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicant’s qualifications. 
        
        - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
        
        - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

       The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
        - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
        - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

    4. **Categorization**:
       - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

       - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

    5. **Structured Report**:
       - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

  expected_output: >
    A JSON structure that accurately reflects matches based on the refined definition of partial matches:
    {
      "applicant_accepted_skills": {
        "applicant_accepted_skills_count": "integer value", (aim for 12-15 skills in total for a balanced overview)

correct_categorization_of_skills_task:
  description: >
    Ensure all skills listed are correctly categorized according to their relevance to specific job fields.

    **Instructions**:
    - Review each skill provided in the list to determine if it is accurately categorized. Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.

      To use the web search tool, 
        query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

    - Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management.
    - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one.
    - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.

    **Output**:
    - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.
    
    Example of a Skills List of tech industry:
    {
      "Programming Languages": ["Python", "Java", "Go"],
      "Project Management": ["Agile Methodologies", "Team Leadership"],
      "Cloud & DevOps": ["AWS", "CI/CD", "Kubernetes"],

ats_friendly_keywords_into_experiences:
  description: >
    Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.

    **Guidelines:**
      - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
      - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
      - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
        -- Limit the short description to 10-13 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
        -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-12 words per key highlight. If possible, split one entry into multiple key highlights to keep them concise.
      - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
      - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
      - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

    **Job Description Keywords:**
    {jd_keywords}

    **Missing from the Applicant's Skills:**

    ## [Other Sections you found in the JSON and you want to include in the resume]

resume_in_json_task:
  description: >
    Your ONLY task is to organize the following input data into a JSON object representing a professional resume, EXACTLY as instructed below. Do NOT deviate from these guidelines:

    1.  **Contact Info:** Extract the following fields: "Full Name", "Phone", "Email", "LinkedIn Profile URL", "Personal Website URL", and "Address".
    2.  **Summary:** Write down the summary provided in the input data.
    3.  **Skills:** Follow the structure below to organize the skills into categories. 
      - First, fill this section from the "exact_match_with_job_description", then "partial_match_with_job_description", then after that, fill from "skills" and "technologies" from the experiences. Each category should have up to 5 skills.
      {{
        "Skills": {{
          "Programming Languages": [],
          "Frameworks": [],
          "Tools": [],
          "Soft Skills": []
        }}
      }}
        - Ensure no skill is repeated. Combine variations of the same skill (e.g., "Problem-Solving" and "Problem-solving skills").
        - Carefully determine if a skill is technical (related to tools, technologies) or soft (related to personality, work style). 
    
    4. If "Company Name" or "Link" is not available, omit them.  
    5.  **Additional:** Include any other relevant sections, like "References," based on the input data.

    **Important:** 
       - You MUST include ALL data from the input. Do NOT leave out any information. If a field is missing, represent it as an empty string ("").
       - Do NOT fabricate, invent, or add ANY information that is not explicitly stated in the input data.
       - Do not infer, assume, or create any details not directly present in the input. 
       - Focus solely on accurately organizing the given information into a structured JSON format. 

    **Input Data**:
    Check the context provided to you.
