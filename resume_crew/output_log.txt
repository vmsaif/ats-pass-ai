Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-07-06 17:04:11: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

```

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

**Instructions**: - Review each skill provided in the list to determine if it is accurately categorized. Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.

  To use the web search tool, 
    query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

- Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management. - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one. - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.
**Output**: - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.
Example of a Skills List of tech industry:
  {

**Instructions**: - Review each skill provided in the list to determine if it is accurately categorized. Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.

  To use the web search tool, 
    query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

- Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management. - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one. - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.
**Output**: - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.

2024-07-08 09:02:25: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**
  - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
  - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
    -- Limit the short description to 10-15 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
    -- Keep up-to 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-20 words per key highlight. If possible, split one entry into multiple key highlights to keep them concise.
  - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

## Personal Statement
This section contains the Applicant's personal statement. 

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-07-13 16:27:38: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**

    -- Keep or make 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-20 words per key highlight. 
    - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

## Personal Statement
This section contains the Applicant's personal statement. 

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

- Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in. To use the web search tool: 
  query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

- Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management. - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one. - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.
**Output**: - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.

**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

2024-07-13 21:47:57: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-07-14 09:36:34: task=Enhance the descriptions of the applicant's experiences by integrating key job description keywords to make them more appealing to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while ensuring they remain readable and relevant.
**Guidelines:**
  - **Relevance:** Integrate keywords that are relevant to the described experience.
  - **Natural Language:** Weave keywords into the narrative seamlessly; they should enhance rather than disrupt the flow.
  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** 
    -- Limit the short description to 10-15 words, focusing on a concise summary of the experience. Make sure it is not redundant with the key highlights below.
    -- Keep or make 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-20 words per key highlight. 
    - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.

create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-08-16 20:37:30: task=Compare the skills listed in a job description with the applicant's skills. This task involves identifying exact matches, researching partial matches, and noting any missing skills. The comparison will utilize two sources: job description keywords and the applicantâ€™s combined skills list, provided in a JSON format.
**Procedure**: 1. **Identification of Matches**:
   - **Exact Match**: Directly compare skills from the job description with the applicant's skills for each category.
   - **Partial Match**: Identify skills in the applicantâ€™s profile that are similar but not identical to those in the job description. Focus on populating as many partial matches as possible by using an online search tool to research each skillâ€™s scope and relevance. This includes exploring related technologies, frameworks, or methodologies that might not be a direct match but are conceptually or functionally similar.
   - **Missing Skills**: List skills present in the job description but absent in the applicantâ€™s profile.

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Prepare a JSON report detailing the types:
      -- **Exact Matches**: Directly matching skills by category.
      -- **Partial Matches**: Populate this section robustly by listing each related skill from the applicant's list that has any connection to the job description skills, including a brief on their relevance or how they complement the job skills.
      -- **Missing Skills**: List skills from the job description that are completely absent in the applicant's skill set.
   - Emphasize more on the partial matches, exploring every possible connection between the applicant's skills and the job requirements to maximize relevance and coverage.

2024-08-16 20:45:42: task=Compare the skills listed in a job description with the applicant's skills. This task involves identifying exact matches, researching partial matches, and noting any missing skills. The comparison will utilize two sources: job description keywords and the applicantâ€™s combined skills list, provided in a JSON format.
**Procedure**: 1. **Identification of Matches**:
   - **Exact Match**: Directly compare skills from the job description with the applicant's skills for each category.
   - **Partial Match**: Identify skills in the applicantâ€™s profile that are similar but not identical to those in the job description. Focus on populating as many partial matches as possible by using an online search tool to research each skillâ€™s scope and relevance. This includes exploring related technologies, frameworks, or methodologies that might not be a direct match but are conceptually or functionally similar.
   - **Missing Skills**: List skills present in the job description but absent in the applicantâ€™s profile.

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Prepare a JSON report detailing the types:
      -- **Exact Matches**: Directly matching skills by category.
      -- **Partial Matches**: Populate this section robustly by listing each related skill from the applicant's list that has any connection to the job description skills, including a brief on their relevance or how they complement the job skills.
      -- **Missing Skills**: List skills from the job description that are completely absent in the applicant's skill set.
   - Emphasize more on the partial matches, exploring every possible connection between the applicant's skills and the job requirements to maximize relevance and coverage.

    -- Keep or make 3 best key highlights for each experience, focusing on the most impactful achievements or skills.
    -- Employ powerful action verbs and succinct phrases to convey significant achievements in approximately 10-20 words per key highlight. 
    - **Contextual Accuracy:** Choose keywords that accurately reflect the skills and responsibilities in the experience. Avoid using keywords that misrepresent the applicant's role or contributions.
  - you are also provided a list of "missing_from_the_applicant_skills" which are in the job description but not in the applicant's experiences. Try to weave some of these words where they fit naturally.
  - **Avoid Keyword Overload:** Maintain a balanced use of keywords to ensure natural readability and effectiveness of the description.
