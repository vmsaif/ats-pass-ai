Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

```
A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-06-30 16:23:12: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-06-30 16:23:50: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool.

**Instructions**: - Review each skill provided in the list to determine if it is accurately categorized. Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.

  To use the web search tool, 
    query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

- Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management. - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one. - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.
**Output**: - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.

This section describes the applicant's self-made philosophy of "creating a magic button" for users, emphasizing intuitive and user-friendly software development.
```
A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-06-30 19:52:05: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

agent=Cross-Match Evaluator with Job Description
2024-06-30 19:52:41: task=Analyze and compare the keywords from a job description (Source 1) to the skills listed in the applicant's profile (Source 2). Ensure that partial matches are functionally or contextually related to the job requirements.
**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

**Instructions**: - Review each skill provided in the list to determine if it is accurately categorized. Use the web search tool to research unfamiliar skills or to verify the appropriateness of the category they are placed in.

  To use the web search tool, 
    query: str = Field(description="search query to look up")

- Categorize skills based on their primary application and industry relevance. For instance, differentiate between technical skills like programming languages and more generic skills such as project management. - Reassign misclassified skills to appropriate categories. If a skill does not fit any existing category, create a new one. - Merge similar categories if they are overly specific or have overlapping skills to simplify the structure.
**Output**: - Provide a revised list with skills accurately placed in categories that reflect their industry and functional relevance. Each category should have 3-5 skills for balance. Keep upto 6 categories in the final output.
Example of a Skills List of tech industry: {
  "Programming Languages": ["Python", "Java", "Go"],

# Summary

This section contains a self-description provided by the Applicant, summarizing their guiding philosophy in software development.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users - one button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind. This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action.

Formulate specific queries to retrieve comprehensive details about their academic history, including institutions, qualifications, and achievements. There may be multiple degrees or educational experiences to consider.
**How to Use the Tool:** - Start by querying the tool with a broad question to gather a complete overview of the Applicant's educational background. If initial results are missing specific details, refine your queries to target these areas.
**Initial Query:** - "question": "What are all the educational qualifications, academic degrees, and related honors or distinctions obtained by the Applicant?"
**Refined Query (if needed):** - If the initial query does not return complete details (such as the name of the institution, degree specifics, GPA, etc.), run additional targeted queries for each missing element. For example:
  - "question": "What is the GPA and graduation year for the Applicant's Bachelor degree?"
  - "question": "List any academic honors or distinctions received by the Applicant during their university education."

For the "Honors/Distinctions" field, Do not get confused with non-academic honors like "Employee of the Month" or "Best Team Player". Only include academic honors like "Summa Cum Laude" or "Dean's List" if available.

# Summary

This section contains a self-description provided by the Applicant, summarizing their guiding philosophy in software development.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users - one button that will do everything the user is thinking

First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

The tool will return a large chunk of information. look "deeply" into the chunk to find your data. If you did not find a field, ask the tool again with the missing field. for example, if you didn't find the GitHub, ask the tool "Do the applicant have GitHub?" to get the GitHub link.
This is what the GitHub profile link looks like: https://github.com/username This is what the GitHub repository link looks like: https://github.com/username/repository_name
If you find the GitHub repository link, simply remove the repository name from the link to make it a GitHub profile link as it will contain the "username". Use that as the GitHub link.

2024-07-01 16:36:02: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

**Task Instructions**:
1. **Sources for Comparison**:
   - **Source 1**: Job Description Keywords.
   - **Source 2**: A JSON Object "combined skills list of applicant" containing the applicant's skills and technologies.

2. **Use of Tool**: It will search the internet. Use the tool to search for unfamiliar skills or technologies to understand their relevance to the job description.
  - Example of an unfamiliar skill: "Langchain". To use the tool,
  query: str = Field(description="What is Langchain, what is it's comparable tools, technology?")
  
3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
    - **Exact Match**: Direct correspondence between the job description and the applicantâ€™s qualifications. 
    
    - **Partial Match**: Skills that are not exactly the same but share similar applications or functionalities as those required by the job. The Job Description Section contains a "Partial_Match" field. Try to match the applicant's skills with the job description's Partial_Match field 
    
    - **missing_from_the_applicant_skills**: Skills that do not align with the job description. Your goal should be to move as many skills as possible from this section to the "Partial Match" after researching their relevance by using the tool. 

   The partial match section has 2 fields per object: 
    - "Skill Name": The skill mentioned in the job description.
    - "Relevance": The relevance of the applicant's with the job description's skill.

4. **Categorization**:
   - Organize skills into categories such as Programming Languages, Soft Skills, AI Frameworks, etc., based on the job description's requirements. Feel free to create category names as you see fit.

   - Aim for a balanced overview by listing 3-5 skills combining exact and partial matches for all categories.

5. **Structured Report**:
   - Generate a JSON report with 'Exact Match' and 'Partial Match' sections, specifying the job-related skill and its relevance to the applicant's skills.

# Summary

This section contains Saif's self-made philosophy of software development.

A unique self-made philosophy has always guided Saif's journey in software development: to create a "magic button" for users. That is, one button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, Saif has always believed that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive, empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, Saif has written every single code line while keeping this philosophy in mind.

# Summary
This section contains the summary of the applicant's career goals and personal drive behind choosing Software Development as a career.
```
A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

2024-07-01 16:48:11: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

# Summary
This section contains the summary of the applicant's career goals and personal drive behind choosing Software Development as a career.
```
A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.

# Summary
This section provides a brief self-description emphasizing the Applicant's approach to software development, highlighting their "magic button" philosophy for user-centric design.
```
A unique self-made philosophy has always guided Saif Mahmud's journey in software development: to create a "magic button" for users - one button to achieve any task. This philosophy emphasizes deeply understanding user needs and crafting intuitive and empowering solutions. While acknowledging current technological limitations, Saif consistently codes with this user-centric approach in mind.  This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, Saif has written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in his mind.

2024-07-02 19:38:14: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-07-02 20:05:05: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-07-02 20:12:32: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.

2024-07-02 20:45:45: task=Your task is to combine skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, and soft skills from two different sources into one comprehensive list. 
First Source: You are provided with a list of skills extracted from the applicant's work experiences and project experiences as context.
Second Source: Use the provided semantic search tool to gather more skills. Simply ask the tool 
"What skills, tools, technologies, frameworks, or soft skills does the applicant have?"
Your job is to merge the skills from both sources into a single list, ensuring no items are omitted and that both sources are represented equally.
You are also provided another web search tool to search for the skills that you are not familiar with to know in which field or category they belong.
