A unique self-made philosophy has always guided my journey in software development: to
create a "magic button" for users. That is, One button should do everything the user wants at this moment. Though this is not possible yet given our technological limitations, I have always believed, that programs should be as simple as that. 

This concept is not just about simplifying interactions but
about deeply understanding the user's needs and crafting solutions that feel intuitive,
empowering, and, above all, magical. It's about creating experiences where complex processes
vanish behind a single, seamless action. One button that will do everything the user is thinking
at the moment. Though this is not possible yet, I have written every single code line while
keeping this philosophy in my mind.
