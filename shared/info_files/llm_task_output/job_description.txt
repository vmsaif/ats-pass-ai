About the job
We are seeking an Applied AI Developer, an expert in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), to join our team. In this role, you would be responsible for building and implementing a wide range of systems that use Generative AI to solve real-world business problems. This is not an R&D role. You will be applying existing generative AI technologies not creating new ones. You will work closely with various internal stakeholders, assessing project feasibility and overseeing the building and implementation of a diverse portfolio of projects. If you excel in translating complex AI requirements into fully-realized, innovative solutions, we’d love to hear from you.

Key Responsibilities: 

Building AI Solutions: Lead the development of AI solutions, ensuring alignment with stakeholder requirements and organizational goals. You will oversee the entire development process, from initial conception to full-fledged implementation
Coding & Prompt Engineering: Utilize Python to integrate various AI services and APIs, creating cohesive AI systems. In prompt engineering, you’ll craft and refine user inputs to effectively guide AI responses, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant outcomes
Feasibility Assessment: Collaborate with stakeholders to assess project feasibility and craft workable action plans based on client requirements
Collaboration & Training: Work with tech teams, delegating components as necessary, and communicate generative AI concepts in clear, accessible language
Defensive Design Strategy: Develop AI solutions with safeguards against abuse, misuse, and prompt injection, ensuring robust, secure systems in line with healthcare standards.


Required Skills: 

Expert knowledge of how to apply generative AI - LLMs such as GPT, LLaMa, and Claude
Proficiency in Python, and APIs such as OpenAI, Azure AI, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex 
Ability to balance rapid proof of concept development with full-stack deployment
Proven experience in developing Generative AI solutions


Desirable Qualifications: 

Excellent communication skills, particularly when explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Knowledge of healthcare regulations is a significant plus
Front-end development experience is beneficial but not required.
