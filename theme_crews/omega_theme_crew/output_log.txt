**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.

Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates.

Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

**Procedure**: - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry. - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
  -- priority of relevance and impact.
  -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
  -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

**Output**: - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry. - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry.  - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.

Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

Job Role: Software Developer - Reliability
Company Name: Robinhood
Location: Toronto, ON

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.
Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

Job Role: Software Developer - Reliability
Company Name: Robinhood
Location: Toronto, ON

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.
Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone. Additionally, Robinhood provides reasonable accommodations for candidates on request and respects applicants' privacy rights. Please review the specific Robinhood Privacy Policy applicable to the country where you are applying.2024-07-06 17:12:46: status=started

Job Role: Software Developer - Reliability
Company Name: Robinhood
Location: Toronto, ON

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.
Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.
Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).

Job Role: Software Developer - Reliability
Company Name: Robinhood
Location: Toronto, ON

Join a leading fintech company that’s democratizing finance for all.
Robinhood Markets was founded on a simple idea: that our financial markets should be accessible to all. With customers at the heart of our decisions, Robinhood and its subsidiaries and affiliates are lowering barriers and providing greater access to financial information. Together, we are building products and services that help create a financial system everyone can participate in.
With growth as the top priority...
The business is seeking curious, growth-minded thinkers to help shape our vision, structures and systems; playing a key-role as we launch into our ambitious future. If you’re invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world — we’d love to have you apply.
About the team + role 
Join our Reliability Engineering team, focused on designing, evolving, and maintaining large-scale distributed systems. As a Software Developer, you'll collaborate across teams to build robust, scalable systems that ensure high availability and low latency.
The Reliability team currently has two significant areas of focus

Building our company wide software system that tracks all outages/SEVs for the organization. A sophisticated tool where all product/infra teams collaborate to identify, remediate, and track significant outages.
Track and monitor our most critical workflows for the business, identifying issues early and being a critical component of long term reliable performance of these core workflows.

As Software Developer, you will combine your software and systems knowledge to engineer distributed systems that are reliable, scaleable and fault-tolerant for Robinhood. You will be part of the larger infrastructure organization where you will work cross functionally with other infra teams to make that a reality.
Our technology stack is primarily built using Python/Go and implemented using container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. We also build our systems using microservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.). Our systems are primarily built within AWS.
What you’ll do

Design and Implement new features and services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
Continually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD and observability.
Act as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability.

What you bring 

Fluent in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).
Experience authoring and operating high-scale services.
Experience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.
Pluses if you have experience with Python/Django/Go and AWS

Our team is here to enable an inclusive and welcoming interview experience for all candidates. If you need additional assistance throughout the interview process related to a physical or mental condition, or if there is something our team can do to enable a more accessible experience at any time, please notify our team by completing this Applicant Accommodation Form.
Click here to learn more about available Benefits, which vary by region and Robinhood entity.
We’re looking for more growth-minded and collaborative people to be a part of our journey in democratizing finance for all. If you’re ready to give 100% in helping us achieve our mission—we’d love to have you apply even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Robinhood, we're looking for people invigorated by our mission, values, and drive to change the world, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Robinhood embraces a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and provides equal opportunity for all applicants and employees. We are dedicated to building a company that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe that the more inclusive we are, the better our work (and work environment) will be for everyone.

   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {

agent=Resume Content Selector2024-07-07 20:00:02: task=Assess the relevance of each section in the applicant's profile and prioritize them based on their alignment with the provided job specifications. 
**Input Data Might Include**: - Education, Relevant Courses, Volunteer Work, Awards, References, Traits, Miscellaneous
**Procedure**: 1. **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate each section's relevance to the job's requirements. 2. **Prioritization**:
   - You can safely ignore the "Skills" section. Do not include it in the output.
   - Ignore empty sections.
   - If available, "Relevant Coursework" is a section of its own. Do not make it a sub-section of Education. Education and Relevant Coursework should be separate sections.
   - Always prioritize at least one "Reference" sub-section if available.
   - Focus on recent and impactful achievements and qualifications.
   - Highlight Education and Awards for their impact.
   - Consider broader sections like Personal Traits if they offer significant benefits.

**Output**: - A JSON object listing sections and sub-sections prioritized by their relevance and impact, ready for final selection in the next task. No need for explanations, reasons or justifications in the output. The output will be in order of priority and their respective sub-sections. Do not remove sub-section fields. Example: ```json {
  "Prioritized Section": {
    "Education": [{Sub-section 1}, {Sub-section 2}],

- Start with a suitable section title like \section{Experience} It will be only 1 time for all experiences.
Organize the experiences as follows: - Title: Use \customTitle{Title}. It is simply the title of the experience. No need to add any additional text.  - Summary points: use \summaryPoints{item 1 | item 2 | item 3}.  - Role and timeline: The provided role and its duration using \roleAndTimeline{Role | Timeline}. - Short description: use \shortDescription{Short Description}. - Key responsibilities and achievements: 
  -- start 'tightemize' environment with \begin{tightemize} 
  -- Each entry of "Key Highlights" will be each \item. Do not remove any key highlights.
  -- End the environment with \end{tightemize}.

Special Character Handling: - Use textbf{} for texts surrounded by double asterisks (**text**) in the "Key Highlights" array. - Format links with \href{}{}, using \ul for underlining. - Escape special characters appropriately (e.g., \%, \&, \#).
Example:
\section{Experience} \customTitle{ATS Pass AI}
    \summaryPoints{Python | Multiagent | AI}
    \roleAndTimeline{Resume Automation Tool - January 2024 - Present}

    \shortDescription{Led the development of an AI-driven project, integrating CrewAI to automate tailored resume creation for enhanced job search efficiency.}

About the job
We are seeking an Applied AI Developer, an expert in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), to join our team. In this role, you would be responsible for building and implementing a wide range of systems that use Generative AI to solve real-world business problems. This is not an R&D role. You will be applying existing generative AI technologies not creating new ones. You will work closely with various internal stakeholders, assessing project feasibility and overseeing the building and implementation of a diverse portfolio of projects. If you excel in translating complex AI requirements into fully-realized, innovative solutions, we’d love to hear from you.

Key Responsibilities: 

Building AI Solutions: Lead the development of AI solutions, ensuring alignment with stakeholder requirements and organizational goals. You will oversee the entire development process, from initial conception to full-fledged implementation
Coding & Prompt Engineering: Utilize Python to integrate various AI services and APIs, creating cohesive AI systems. In prompt engineering, you’ll craft and refine user inputs to effectively guide AI responses, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant outcomes
Feasibility Assessment: Collaborate with stakeholders to assess project feasibility and craft workable action plans based on client requirements
Collaboration & Training: Work with tech teams, delegating components as necessary, and communicate generative AI concepts in clear, accessible language
Defensive Design Strategy: Develop AI solutions with safeguards against abuse, misuse, and prompt injection, ensuring robust, secure systems in line with healthcare standards.


Required Skills: 

Expert knowledge of how to apply generative AI - LLMs such as GPT, LLaMa, and Claude
Proficiency in Python, and APIs such as OpenAI, Azure AI, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex 
Ability to balance rapid proof of concept development with full-stack deployment
Proven experience in developing Generative AI solutions


Desirable Qualifications: 

Excellent communication skills, particularly when explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Knowledge of healthcare regulations is a significant plus
Front-end development experience is beneficial but not required.


Klick is consciously creating a culture where everyone can thrive and grow in their careers. We believe that our best work comes from our diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We strongly encourage members of historically underrepresented communities to apply, including Black people, Indigenous peoples, and other people of colour, people with disabilities, people from gender and sexually diverse communities and people with intersectional identities.

We’re also committed to developing an inclusive, barrier-free recruitment process and work environment. Should you require any accommodation, please contact us at careers@klick.com and we will work with you to meet your accessibility needs and ensure you have a positive experience.2024-07-13 19:37:15: status=started

About the job
We are seeking an Applied AI Developer, an expert in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), to join our team. In this role, you would be responsible for building and implementing a wide range of systems that use Generative AI to solve real-world business problems. This is not an R&D role. You will be applying existing generative AI technologies not creating new ones. You will work closely with various internal stakeholders, assessing project feasibility and overseeing the building and implementation of a diverse portfolio of projects. If you excel in translating complex AI requirements into fully-realized, innovative solutions, we’d love to hear from you.

Key Responsibilities: 

Building AI Solutions: Lead the development of AI solutions, ensuring alignment with stakeholder requirements and organizational goals. You will oversee the entire development process, from initial conception to full-fledged implementation
Coding & Prompt Engineering: Utilize Python to integrate various AI services and APIs, creating cohesive AI systems. In prompt engineering, you’ll craft and refine user inputs to effectively guide AI responses, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant outcomes
Feasibility Assessment: Collaborate with stakeholders to assess project feasibility and craft workable action plans based on client requirements
Collaboration & Training: Work with tech teams, delegating components as necessary, and communicate generative AI concepts in clear, accessible language
Defensive Design Strategy: Develop AI solutions with safeguards against abuse, misuse, and prompt injection, ensuring robust, secure systems in line with healthcare standards.


Required Skills: 

Expert knowledge of how to apply generative AI - LLMs such as GPT, LLaMa, and Claude
Proficiency in Python, and APIs such as OpenAI, Azure AI, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex 
Ability to balance rapid proof of concept development with full-stack deployment
Proven experience in developing Generative AI solutions


Desirable Qualifications: 

Excellent communication skills, particularly when explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Knowledge of healthcare regulations is a significant plus
Front-end development experience is beneficial but not required.
