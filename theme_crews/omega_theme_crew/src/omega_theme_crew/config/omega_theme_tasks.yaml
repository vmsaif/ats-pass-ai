    Extract the personal information of the applicant from the provided data. Then convert the extracted data into the LaTeX format. If you don't find any information at all, the output should be empty.

    In the output, 
    - The first line contains the name. Use the command \namesection{First Name and Middle Name if available}{Last Name}.
    - Then the next line will contain the URLs. Use the command \urlstyle{same} to keep the URLs in the same style as the text. The line will contain urls up to 2. then \\ to linebreak. Use \href for the URLs. The argument of \href should be the URL and the text should be the URL without the protocol.
    - The third line will contain the email, phone number, and location. Use the command \href for the email. The argument of \href should be the email and the text should be the email. The phone number should be in the format of 204 955 5064. The location should be in the format of a City or province.
    - Pipeline '|' should be used to separate the data and must not be the last character of the output.

    Example:
    ```latex
      \namesection{Saif}{Mahmud}
      {
        \urlstyle{same}\href{https://saifmahmud.dev}{saifmahmud.dev} | \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}{linkedin.com/in/vmsaif}\\

  expected_output: >

concise_jd_task:
  description: >
    Summarize the provided job description into a concise format that highlights the essential responsibilities and requirements of the role. This summary should efficiently encapsulate the key elements of the job to aid in determining which sections of an applicant's profile (such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, Miscellaneous) are most relevant and should be included in a resume. The summary should serve as a reference for another agent responsible for selecting the appropriate resume sections based on the job alignment.

    The concise summary should be both informative and succinct, providing clear guidance without overwhelming detail. No need to hint which sections to select, just summarize the job description with the next agent's task in mind.
  expected_output: >

exp_item_count_chooser:
  description: >
    Evaluate and determine the number of allowable key highlights for each experience entry, adjusting based on link presence and total experience count.

    **Procedure**:
      - For each experience entry, determine if a link is included.
      - Create a field "Link found" either "True" or "False" based on the presence of a link within that entry.
      - Create a field "Allow Key Highlights Count" with the determined value based on the rules below.

      Rules:
      - If a link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "2". No need to actually remove anything.
      - If no link is present, "Allow Key Highlights Count": "3". No need to actually remove anything.
      - Do not change or remove any other content of the JSON object in the output.

    **Output**:
    - A JSON object with the same entries as the input and the "Link found" and "Allow Key Highlights Count" fields added.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with the same entries as the input and the "Link found" and "Allow Key Highlights Count" fields added.

exp_item_chooser:
  description: >
    Trim the "Key Highlights" for each entry based on the "Allow Key Highlights Count," ensuring that the highlights retained are most relevant to the job description.

    **Procedure**:
    - Check what is the value of "Allow Key Highlights Count" for that entry.
    - You need to keep only the "Allow Key Highlights Count" number of key highlights for that entry. In case there are more key highlights, keep them based on the: 
      -- priority of relevance and impact.
      -- Demonstrate measurable achievements or skills critical to the job.
      -- Highlight significant contributions or use of key technologies.

    **Output**:
    - A JSON object that mirrors the structure of the input but includes only the prioritized key highlights for each entry.
    - For Example, if "Allow Key Highlights Count" is "2", the "Key Highlights" array should contain only the best 2 highlights based on relevance and impact for that entry. 
    - Similar steps should be followed for all entries.

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with adjusted "Key Highlights" for each entry, reflecting prioritization based on relevance and impact relative to the job description.

summary_point_selector:
  description: >
    **Procedure**:
    - Review the "Technologies, frameworks, and tools Used" and "Skills" for each experience.
    - Select 3-4 summary points from these fields, ensuring each point consists of 1-2 words. The combined length of all summary points must not exceed 4 words.
    - Prioritize the inclusion of specific technologies and skill names that best represent the experience.
    - Remove the original "Technologies, frameworks, and tools Used" and "Skills" fields from each entry.
    - Add a new field named "Summary Points" to each experience entry, containing the selected summary points.

    **Output**:
    - A JSON object that retains the original structure but includes the new "Summary Points" field in each entry, reflecting the concise highlights of each experience.
  expected_output: >

link_handler:
  description: >
    You are provided with multiple experiences in JSON format where each experience has a "Key Highlights" array.
    
    If a Link is present in the experience:
    - Append the "Link" inside the "Key Highlights" array.
    - Remove only the "Link" field from the experience. 
    - Remove the "Allow Count" and "Count Reason" fields if present.
    Keep all other fields as they are such as "Title", "Role", "Timeline", "Duration", "Summary Points", "Short Description" etc.
    - Do not replace any key highlights.

  expected_output: >

link_latex:
  description: >
    You are provided with multiple experiences in JSON format where each experience has a "Key Highlights" array. 

    **Procedure**:
    - If a link is present in the "Key Highlights" array, format it in LaTeX using the \href{}{} command. 
    - Write the link in as a sentence in the format. Understand what the link is about and write the sentence accordingly.
      -- Example:
      Assume the hyperlink is "profile" and the link is "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/".

    - "See my linkedin \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}{\ul{profile}}."
    - Do not change or remove any other content of the json object.
  expected_output: >

experience_section:
  description: >
    Format the applicant's experiences from the provided data into LaTeX format. 
    
    - Start with a suitable section title like \section{Experience} It will be only 1 time for all experiences.

    Organize the experiences as follows:
    - Title: Use \customTitle{Title}. It is simply the title of the experience. No need to add any additional text. 
    - Summary points: use \summaryPoints{item 1 | item 2 | item 3}. 
    - Role and timeline: The provided role and its duration using \roleAndTimeline{Role | Timeline}.
    - Short description: use \shortDescription{Short Description}.
    - Key responsibilities and achievements: 
      -- start 'tightemize' environment with \begin{tightemize} 
      -- Each entry of "Key Highlights" will be each \item. Do not remove any key highlights.
      -- End the environment with \end{tightemize}.
    
    Special Character Handling:
    - Use textbf{} for texts surrounded by double asterisks (**text**) in the "Key Highlights" array.
    - Format links with \href{}{}, using \ul for underlining.
    - Escape special characters appropriately (e.g., \%, \&, \#).

    Example:

    \section{Experience}
    \customTitle{ATS Pass AI}
        \summaryPoints{Python | Multiagent | AI}
        \roleAndTimeline{Resume Automation Tool - January 2024 - Present}
