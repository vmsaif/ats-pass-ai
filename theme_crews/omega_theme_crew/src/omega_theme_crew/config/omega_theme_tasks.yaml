    Extract the personal information of the applicant from the provided data. Then convert the extracted data into the LaTeX format. If you don't find any information at all, the output should be empty.

    In the output, 
    - The first line contains the name. Use the command \namesection{First Name and Middle Name if available}{Last Name}.
    - Then the next line will contain the URLs. Use the command \urlstyle{same} to keep the URLs in the same style as the text. The line will contain urls up to 2. then \\ to linebreak. Use \href for the URLs. The argument of \href should be the URL and the text should be the URL without the protocol.
    - The third line will contain the email, phone number, and location. Use the command \href for the email. The argument of \href should be the email and the text should be the email. The phone number should be in the format of 204 955 5064. The location should be in the format of a City or province.
    - Pipeline '|' should be used to separate the data and must not be the last character of the output.

    Example:
    ```latex
      \namesection{Saif}{Mahmud}
      {
        \urlstyle{same}\href{https://saifmahmud.dev}{saifmahmud.dev} | \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}{linkedin.com/in/vmsaif}\\
        \href{mailto:msaifofficial@gmail.com}{msaifofficial@gmail.com} | 204 955 5064 | Winnipeg, MB
      }
    ```

    Here is the information you need and convert into LaTeX format:
  expected_output: >

concise_jd_task:
  description: >
    Summarize the provided job description into a concise format that highlights the essential responsibilities and requirements of the role. This summary should efficiently encapsulate the key elements of the job to aid in determining which sections of an applicant's profile (such as Education, Volunteer Work, Awards and Recognitions, References, Personal Traits and Interests, Miscellaneous) are most relevant and should be included in a resume. The summary should serve as a reference for another agent responsible for selecting the appropriate resume sections based on the job alignment.

    The concise summary should be both informative and succinct, providing clear guidance without overwhelming detail. No need to hint which sections to select, just summarize the job description with the next agent's task in mind.
  expected_output: >
    A concise summary of the job description, no more than 2000 characters, effectively outlining the main responsibilities and essential qualifications required for the role. This summary should provide enough information to facilitate effective decision-making regarding the inclusion of relevant sections in the applicant's resume.

final_selection:
  description: >
    This task involves evaluating each major section of the applicant's profile for relevance to the job, assigning relevance scores, and finalizing the selection of prioritized sections based on their assessed relevance.

    **Input Data**:
    - Extracted and structured profile data:
      {profile_builder}
      {coursework_extraction}

    - Job description criteria:
      {concise_jd}
      ----Job Description Criteria ends here----

    **Procedure**:

    1. First ignore sections: "Personal Information", "Personal Traits and Interests", and "Applicant's Philosophy and Goals". After the removal, Follow the next steps.

    2. **Relevance Assessment**:
      Keep 4 most relevant sub-sections from the given context of the applicant's profile that align with the job description criteria.
      Use a relevance score between 0 and 10 for each sub-section based on the provided job information. Keep the most relevant sub-sections based on the scores.

    3. If "Relevant Coursework (to the Job Description)" is provided, include all courses as one separate sub-section under the "Relevant Courses" section.

    3. **Final Selection**:
      - Always include at least one sub-section from the "References" section if provided.
      - Then include a total of 4 available sub-sections across all sections. Do not make up any sub-sections if they are not available.

    **Output**:
    - Generate a formatted JSON object ready for use, incorporating the selected sections and sub-sections based on the defined criteria. This output should clearly present each major section with its detailed content and an associated relevance score. 

  expected_output: >
    Four most relevant sub-sections from the applicant's profile, related to the job description criteria, with detailed content and relevance scores.

experience_content_refinement:
  description: >
    This task involves refining and formatting the content of JSON-formatted experiences. The process includes selecting summary points, handling links, and formatting links in LaTeX within the "Key Highlights" array.

    **Procedure**:
    1. **Summary Point Selection**:
       - Review the "Technologies, frameworks, and tools Used" and "Skills" for each experience.
       - Select 3-4 summary points from these fields, ensuring each point consists of 1-2 words. The combined length of all summary points must not exceed 4 words.
       - Prioritize the inclusion of specific technologies and skill names that best represent the experience.
       - Remove the original "Technologies, frameworks, and tools Used" and "Skills" fields from each entry.
       - Add a new field named "Summary Points" to each experience entry, containing the selected summary points.

    2. **Link Handling**:
       - If a Link is present in the experience:
         - Append the "Link" inside the "Key Highlights" array.
         - Remove only the "Link" field from the experience.
         - Remove the "Allow Count" and "Count Reason" fields if present.
         - Keep all other fields as they are such as "Title", "Role", "Timeline", "Duration", "Summary Points", "Short Description", etc.

    3. **LaTeX Link Formatting**:
       - Check if a link is present in the "Key Highlights" array.
       - If a link is present, format it in LaTeX using the \href{{url}}{{\ul{{link text}}}} command.
       - Write the link as a sentence in the format: "See my linkedin \href{{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}}{{\ul{{profile}}}}." Understand what the link is about and write the sentence and {{text}} accordingly. 
       - Do not make up any links or sentences.
       - Do not change or remove any other content of the JSON object.

    4. For timeline, use 3 letters of the month and year. For example, January 2020 should be Jan 2020. 

    **Output**:
    - A JSON object that retains the original structure but includes the new "Summary Points" field in each entry, with links appropriately handled and formatted within the "Key Highlights" array.

    Here is the context you need and convert into LaTeX format:
    {experience_content}

  expected_output: >
    {
      "Experience": [
        {
          "Title": "Software Engineer",
          "Role": "Lead Developer",
          "Timeline": "January 2020 - Present",
          "Duration": "2 years",
          "Summary Points": ["Python", "AI"],
          "Key Highlights": [
            "Led a team of 10 in developing an AI-based predictive analytics tool.",
            "See my linkedin \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmsaif/}{\ul{profile}}."
          ],
          "Short Description": "Managed project from inception to deployment, significantly improving process efficiencies."
        },
        ...other experiences
      ]
    }

experience_section:
  description: >
    Format the applicant's experiences from the provided data into LaTeX format. 
    
    - Start with a suitable section title like \section{Experience} It will be only 1 time for all experiences.

    Organize the experiences as follows:
    - Title: Use \customTitle{Title}. It is simply the title of the experience. No need to add any additional text. 
    - Summary points: use \summaryPoints{item 1 | item 2 | item 3}. 
    - Role and timeline: The provided role and its duration using \roleAndTimeline{Role | Timeline}.
    - Short description: use \shortDescription{Short Description}.
    - Key responsibilities and achievements: 
      -- start 'tightemize' environment with \begin{tightemize} 
      -- Each entry of "Key Highlights" will be each \item. Do not remove any key highlights.
      -- End the environment with \end{tightemize}.
    
    Special Character Handling:
    - Use textbf{} for texts surrounded by double asterisks (**text**) in the "Key Highlights" array.
    - Format links with \href{}{}, using \ul for underlining.
    - Escape special characters appropriately (e.g., \%, \&, \#).
