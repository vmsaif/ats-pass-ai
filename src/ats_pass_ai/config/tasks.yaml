    Your task is to analyze and compare the keywords and phrases from a job post, which have already been extracted, against the context provided to you. 
    
    Evaluate the degree of similarity between these keywords.

    Source 1 (Job Description Keywords): 
    """{src_1}"""

    Source 2 (User's Skills and Technologies, Frameworks, Tools, Soft Skills, etc.) from the context provided. 

  expected_output: >
    Produce a structured report that categorizes the findings into 'Exact Match', 'Partial Match', or 'No Match'. 

    **Skills Matched With Job Description:**

    - **'Exact Match'**: Direct matches between job description requirements and applicant’s qualifications. An exact match is a skill or experience that is mentioned in both the job description and the applicant's profile using the same or very similar terms.

      Example:

      Exact Match:
        - Technical Skills, frameworks, tools:
          - item 1
          - item 2
        - Soft Skills:
          - item 1
          - item 2

    - **'Partial Match'**: Skills or experiences that are somehow related but not identical to the job requirements.

      Example:

      Partial Match:
        - Technical Skills, frameworks, tools:
          - item 1 (Similar to Java required by job)
          - item 2 (Related to SQL databases required by job)
        - Soft Skills:
          - Negotiation (Related to requested persuasion skills)

    **No Match**: Skills mentioned in the job description but are not present in the applicant's profile.

      Example:

ats_friendly_experience_enhancement_task:
  description: >
    This task helps you create compelling resume bullet points by adding important
    keywords from a job description to descriptions of your work experiences.
    The goal is to make these descriptions stand out to Applicant Tracking
    Systems (ATS), while also being easy to read and understand.

    guidelines:
      - **Relevance:** Only use keywords that truly fit with the experience you're
        describing.
      - **Natural Language:** Keywords should fit smoothly into the sentences. Don't
        just list keywords or force them in where they don't belong.
      - **Conciseness and Clarity:** Use strong action verbs and remove unnecessary
        words. Focus on making a big impact with few words. Summarize each
        experience in 1-2 short, powerful sentences, just like you would on a resume.
      - **Context Matters:** Think about the overall story of each experience. Pick
        keywords that accurately show the skills you used and what you were
        responsible for.
